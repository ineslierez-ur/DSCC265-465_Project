## Pre-Analysis:

### Explore the data.ipynb

This is a Jupyter notebook we have used to explore the possible data sets we have found and to familiarize ourselves with them. 

## Explanatory Analysis:

Please, write a short summary of what each notebook does here.

## Predictive Analysis:

### Prediction_Part1_data_preparation_pre_analysis.ipynb

This is the initial notebook used before starting the predictive analysis. Here, we realize that we should be replacing the missing values in the data with mean or median.

### Prediction_Part1_data_preparation.ipynb

This is the notebook that returns the data set that is ready to being used for predictive models. The data here is normalized and also involves columns returned by the dimensionality reduction methods of PCA, spectral embedding, and t-SNE.
