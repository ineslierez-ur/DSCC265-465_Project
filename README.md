## Pre-Analysis:

### Exploring the data.ipynb

We explore possible data sets available and explore the data set of our choice. We plot correlation matrices.

## Explanatory Analysis:

## Predictive Models:

### Prediction_Part1_data_preparation_pre_analysis.ipynb

While preparing the data before building accuracy-focused predictive models, we explore the data and decide to replace null values with the mean for the state or the column.

### Prediction_Part1_data_preparation.ipynb

This notebook prepares the data to be fed into the predictive models that assumes no prior knowledge or analysis about the data. The output files are the file that contains the target variable and the file that contains all the explanatory features. We also add columnsfor the 3 principal components returned by dimensionality methods including PCA, spectral embedding, and t-SNE.
